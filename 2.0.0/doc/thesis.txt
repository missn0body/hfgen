I am a lazy bastard and I find header preprocessors, stuff like 'extern "C" {'
and '#ifndef __cplusplus' to be rather cumbersome. More often than not I have wanted
a program to spit out a templated version that I can simply start adding code to.
This isn't something that is always appropriate, but in the last couple of projects
I've noticed that most of my header files look relatively the same. Maybe that is a
testament to what I know about preprocessing directives, or maybe that says more about
the projects I do, but this tool is first and foremost for me.

This program first and foremost has to end #if... directives with a comment block
(e.g. "/* if statement from earlier */") as a courtesy to those who view the header
file. This was a limitation that I found earlier with my previous version of 'hfgen'
and I want to specifically rectify that with this version.

This program also needs to apply guards for C code linked with C++ code as well as to
protect C++ code from being linked with C code. And of course this current version will
not be the be-all, end-all version. Products are but hundereds or even thousands of tiny
iterations and modifications. My needs as well as the needs of the ones who use this code
will change in the future in ways I can not predict.

The above is subject to non-radical change. The 'sample...' files here are sample output
that you should expect 'hfgen' to output. These files were originally used for my
reference, so now they are your references.
