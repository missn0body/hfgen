# hfgen

A simple C/C++ header file generator.  
Created in 2024 by anson.

You see, I am lazy, and I try to find the easiest and least time consuming
ways to do everything, including creating header files. This might have been
a questionable use of time and resources, but I hope that I as well as anyone
else using this code benefits at least a little bit, which is always worth it.

Within the version folders is a `doc` folder that holds sample generated header
files to have an idea of what this program generates, which should just be an
average, simple header file. This folder also holds the thesis statement for that
version.

Usage and options are explained in the first section of `hfgen.cpp`, and can
be read by invoking `hfgen --help` at the command line. This project is licensed
