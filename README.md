# hfgen

A simple C/C++ header file generator. Created in 2024 by anson.

Much like my other program `momk`, this is another generator that I hope
to speed up my personal workflow at least a little bit, and also I think it's
both a good programming excercise as well as possibly helping anyone that comes
across this code. And much like `momk`, this is only one .c file that you can
compile, in all fairness it doesn't have much moving parts and didn't really
need multiple sources and multiple headers. Point being that these projects
are supposed to be small.

For a list of commands, type `hfgen --help` at the command line, or take a peek
at the code since the output is pretty straight-forward.

### v.1.0.0 (Initial release)
